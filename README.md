# Operationalizing-an-AWS-ML-Project
##Using tools and features of AWS to adjust, improve, configure, and prepare a machine learning model for production-grade deployment. 
This project consists of the following steps:

1) Training and deploying a model on Sagemaker, using the most appropriate instances. Setting up multi-instance training in a Sagemaker notebook.
2) Adjusting the Sagemaker notebook to perform training and deployment on EC2.
3) Setting up a Lambda function for the deployed model. Setting up auto-scaling for the deployed endpoint as well as concurrency for the Lambda function.
4) Ensuring that the security on the ML pipeline is set up properly.
